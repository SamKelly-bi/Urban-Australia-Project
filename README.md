## Project Overview 📁
Inspired by a similar study conducted by New York–based urban consultancy firm Resonance, this project evaluates Australia’s eight largest metropolitan areas across three core dimensions:

**Livability:** Measuring the quality of a city’s natural and built environments and how they contribute to a strong sense of place.

**Lovability:** Assessing the cultural vibrancy, amenities, and overall appeal of a city for residents and visitors.

**Prosperity:** Evaluating the strength of a city’s human capital and its capacity to generate economic value and long-term wellbeing.
