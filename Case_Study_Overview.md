# Australan Urban Analysis - Final Report

## Executive Summary
After reviewing Resonance Consultancy’s ![2025 Best Cities in the USA report]([https://www.worldsbestcities.com/rankings/](www.worldsbestcities.com/rankings/americas-best-cities/](https://www.worldsbestcities.com/rankings/americas-best-cities/), I was inspired to undertake a comparable analysis focused on Australian cities.

This study evaluates and ranks major Australian cities across a broad set of indicators, including **Median Household Income**, **Cultural Attractions**, and **Business Ecosystem strength**. Where possible, I adopted the same metrics, data sources, and methodological approach used by Resonance to ensure consistency, comparability, and analytical rigor.

The analysis combines **SQL-based data exploration**, an **Excel-driven z-score normalization framework**, and an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to present results in a clear, data-driven, and accessible format. Together, these tools provide a comprehensive view of each city’s relative performance across livability, lovability, and economic opportunity.
